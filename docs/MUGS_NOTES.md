# Mug's Guide to Code

Yo! Here's da deal. I ain't no fancy programmer, but I knows enough to get by. This here's my guide.

## What's Important in Code

1. **Make it Work**: It's gotta do what it's s'posed to do. Don't be fancy, just make it work.
2. **Make it Fast**: Who's got time to wait? Not me, that's who.
3. **Make it, uh, Good**: Like, don't make it a mess, ya know?

## My Favrit Code Snippets

I dunno much 'bout this markdown stuff, but here's some code I likes.

```
if (isGoodCode) {
    console.log("This is some good code, see?");
} else {
    console.log("Nah, this code's no good, see?");
}
```

## Conclusion

Coding ain't hard. Just type stuff and make sure it works. And if it don't, keep pokin' it with a stick till it does.

Oh, and if youse got questions, don't ask me. I'm just a mug, remember?
