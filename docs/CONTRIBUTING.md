# Contributing to Project Noir

So, you've decided to contribute to Project Noir? Brave soul. Here are some guidelines to ensure your contribution doesn't end up in the digital abyss.

## Ground Rules
- **Style Matters**: Write code like Hemingway wrote novels: concise and to the point.
- **Test Before You Push**: Your code should work. If it doesn't, it'll be sent back faster than a cold cup of coffee.
- **Document Your Code**: Comments are your friends. Don't leave your friends behind.

## Pull Requests
1. **Fork the Repository**: Like stealing a car, but legal.
2. **Create a Branch**: Call it something snazzy. `fix/that-one-bug` or `feature/that-cool-thing`.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Add. Fix. Improve. But don't break. Please.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Write a commit message that could wake up a sleeping detective.
5. **Push to Your Fork**: Send your code off into the great digital yonder.
6. **Open a Pull Request**: Fill in the template. The more info, the better.

## Need Help?
If you're lost, confused, or just need someone to talk to about code, open an issue. We're as friendly as a bunch of introverted coders can be.
