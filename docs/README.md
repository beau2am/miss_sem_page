# Project Noir

## What's This?
Welcome to Project Noir, the repository so secretive, even I don't know what it does half the time. It's a collection of scripts, actions, and digital incantations designed to make your coding life slightly less miserable.

## Features
- **Shell Script Validation**: Like a grammar school teacher with a red pen, but for your code.
- **Markdown Linting**: Because typos in documentation are more embarrassing than spinach in your teeth.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate your tedium because, let's face it, you have better things to do.

## How to Use
1. **Don't Panic**: It's just code, not a bomb defusal manual.
2. **Read the Scripts**: They're commented, which is more than I can say for some mystery novels.
3. **Test**: Run them, break them, fix them. Rinse and repeat.

## Contact
- **Issues**: Open a ticket. It's like yelling into the void, but occasionally someone responds.
- **Pull Requests**: Feel free to contribute, but remember, I'll be watching. Closely.
